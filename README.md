# Quest System in Unity
This is a project I made as a system that can be reused in different game development projects. The Quest System functions as a todo list for the player.

This quest system lets you specify in game actions to listen for, build tasks for the player, and build quests made up of those tasks.
The `QuestManager` uses C# Events to update active quests and their contained tasks.
The `QuestManager` also contains a Queue for Quests that can be used as a quest line.

To see an example of its use, I provided a demo project with a walkthrough of its integration with the Quest System.
